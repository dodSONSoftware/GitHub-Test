# The **ClassLib** Folder

This folder contains folders for the project's code, third-party assemblies and unit testing and integration testing code. 

The name **ClassLib** is only used here as an example; this folder should be the last named element of your project's name. 

If your project was named **Globeranger.Solutions.Components.Widget** then this folder would be called **Widget**.
